# OpenAI GPT Integration Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. **OpenAI Client Implementation** (`src/llm/openai.py`)
- Created a complete OpenAI client that uses the Chat Completions API via proxy
- Supports three GPT models:
  - O4 Mini (o4-mini-2025-04-16) - Reasoning model
  - GPT-4.1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) - Non-reasoning model
  - GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-08-06) - Non-reasoning model
- Implements thinking mode through system prompts
- Handles multimodal content (text + images)
- Uses httpx for async HTTP requests

### 2. **Updated LLM Module** (`src/llm/__init__.py`)
- Added OpenAIClient to exports
- Maintains clean module interface

### 3. **Updated Factory** (`src/llm/factory.py`)
- Registered OpenAI provider in the factory
- Users can now create OpenAI clients with `LLMFactory.create("openai")`

### 4. **Updated Settings** (`src/config/settings.py`)
- Added OpenAI models to AVAILABLE_MODELS dictionary
- Added proxy endpoint configuration for OpenAI
- Uses the same VORREN_API_KEY for authentication

### 5. **Updated Callbacks** (`src/bot/callbacks.py`)
- Added GPT model options to the settings menu
- Updated model display logic to show correct names for GPT models
- Fixed hardcoded references to be dynamic

### 6. **Updated Handlers** (`src/bot/handlers.py`)
- Modified to dynamically select LLM provider based on model
- Updated footer to show correct model name for GPT models
- Properly routes requests to OpenAI client for GPT models

### 7. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated README_REFACTORED.md to mention OpenAI support
- Updated SETUP_GUIDE.md with GPT model information
- Created test_openai.py for testing the integration

## How It Works

1. When a user selects a GPT model in `/settings`, the model preference is saved to the database
2. When processing a message, the handler checks if the model is a GPT model
3. If it's GPT, it creates an OpenAI client via the factory
4. The OpenAI client sends requests to the Vorren proxy endpoint using the Chat Completions API format
5. For thinking mode, it adds a system prompt to encourage step-by-step reasoning
6. The proxy handles the actual communication with OpenAI's API
7. Responses are parsed and formatted
8. The response is sent back to the user

## Configuration Required

Uses the same VORREN_API_KEY as Anthropic:
```env
VORREN_API_KEY=your_vorren_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Use `/settings` command
2. Select "ðŸ¤– Change Model"
3. Choose from:
   - âš¡ Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - ðŸ’Ž Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - ðŸŽ­ Claude Sonnet 4
   - ðŸŽ¨ Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - ðŸš€ Claude 3.5 Sonnet
   - ðŸ§  O4 Mini (Reasoning)
   - ðŸ¤– GPT-4.1
   - ðŸ¤– GPT-4o

The bot will automatically route requests to the appropriate provider based on the selected model.

## Thinking Mode

OpenAI models support thinking mode through system prompts. When thinking mode is enabled:
- A system prompt is added to encourage step-by-step reasoning
- The response is analyzed to separate thinking process from final answer
- Both sections are formatted with clear labels when possible

## Testing

You can test the OpenAI integration by running:
```bash
python test_openai.py
```

This will verify that all three models work correctly with the Chat Completions API via the proxy.

## Model Capabilities

- **O4 Mini (Reasoning)**: This is a reasoning model that excels at step-by-step problem solving
- **GPT-4.1**: Non-reasoning model for general conversations
- **GPT-4o**: Non-reasoning model for general conversations

## Important Constraints

- **Temperature**: All three models only support temperature=1.0 (default). Any other temperature value will be ignored and 1.0 will be used.
- The client automatically handles this constraint and logs when a different temperature was requested.
