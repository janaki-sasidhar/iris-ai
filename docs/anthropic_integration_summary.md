# Anthropic Claude Integration Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. **Anthropic Client Implementation** (`src/llm/anthropic.py`)
- Created a complete Anthropic client that uses the Messages API via proxy
- Supports all three Claude models:
  - Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
  - Claude 3.7 Sonnet (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
- Implements proper thinking mode support using Anthropic's native thinking API
- Correctly parses thinking content from the response format
- Clearly separates thinking process from response with labeled sections
- Handles API constraints:
  - Temperature must be 1.0 when thinking is enabled
  - Max tokens must be greater than thinking budget
- Provides user-friendly error messages without exposing API details
- Handles multimodal content (text + images)
- Uses httpx for async HTTP requests

### 2. **Updated LLM Module** (`src/llm/__init__.py`)
- Added AnthropicClient to exports
- Maintains clean module interface

### 3. **Updated Factory** (`src/llm/factory.py`)
- Registered Anthropic provider in the factory
- Users can now create Anthropic clients with `LLMFactory.create("anthropic")`

### 4. **Updated Settings** (`src/config/settings.py`)
- Added VORREN_API_KEY configuration
- Added Claude models to AVAILABLE_MODELS dictionary
- Added proxy endpoint configuration for Messages API

### 5. **Updated Callbacks** (`src/bot/callbacks.py`)
- Added Claude model options to the settings menu
- Updated model display logic to show correct names for Claude models
- Fixed hardcoded "Gemini" references to be dynamic

### 6. **Updated Handlers** (`src/bot/handlers.py`)
- Modified to dynamically select LLM provider based on model
- Updated footer to show correct model name (not just Gemini)
- Properly routes requests to Anthropic client for Claude models

### 7. **Updated Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
- Added httpx==0.27.0 for HTTP requests

### 8. **Documentation Updates**
- Updated README_REFACTORED.md to mention Anthropic support
- Updated SETUP_GUIDE.md with Vorren API key instructions
- Created .env.example with all required environment variables

### 9. **Test Script** (`test_anthropic.py`)
- Created comprehensive test script for Anthropic integration
- Tests all three Claude models
- Tests both normal and thinking mode

## How It Works

1. When a user selects a Claude model in `/settings`, the model preference is saved to the database
2. When processing a message, the handler checks if the model is a Claude model
3. If it's Claude, it creates an Anthropic client via the factory
4. The Anthropic client sends requests to the Vorren proxy endpoint using the Messages API format
5. For thinking mode, it adds a `thinking` object with `type: "enabled"` and a token budget
6. When thinking mode is enabled:
   - Temperature is automatically set to 1.0 as required by the API
   - Max tokens is set to 10,000 (default)
   - Thinking budget is set to 5,000 tokens
7. The proxy handles the actual communication with Claude's API
8. Responses are parsed to extract both thinking and text content:
   - Thinking content is extracted from content blocks with `type: "thinking"`
   - Text content is extracted from content blocks with `type: "text"`
9. Both thinking and response are formatted with clear labels:
   - Thinking section is labeled with "ðŸ§  **Thinking Process:**"
   - Response section is labeled with "ðŸ’¬ **Response:**"
10. API errors are logged but not exposed to users

## Configuration Required

Add to your `.env` file:
```env
VORREN_API_KEY=your_vorren_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Use `/settings` command
2. Select "ðŸ¤– Change Model"
3. Choose from:
   - âš¡ Gemini 2.5 Flash
   - ðŸ’Ž Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - ðŸŽ­ Claude Sonnet 4
   - ðŸŽ¨ Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - ðŸš€ Claude 3.5 Sonnet

The bot will automatically route requests to the appropriate provider based on the selected model.
